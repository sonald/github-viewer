github source code viewer
-------------------------
this is just for fun. I use several great projects for this. [node-webkit][]
is used for UI powered by html and css. It's also highly experimental,
and not suitable for product use. [CodeMirror][] for source code hightlighting
and present. and finally [node-github][] for interfacing with github repos.
